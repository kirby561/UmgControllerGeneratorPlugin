# UmgControllerGeneratorPlugin
This is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that allows you to automatically generate a controller class for a given Widget Blueprint from within the Unreal Editor. It also provides the ability to update those h/cpp files automatically from within the editor when adding more widgets. The header files are automatically found and included as well.
